## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to use this library inside your projects

### Prerequisites

This library was built with **androidX**, so you should migrate into androidX to use this library with out any problem. For migration you can use [Migrating to AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate)

### Installing

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file,
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```gradle
allprojects {
        repositories {
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }
```

Step 2. Add the dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.HamidrezaAmz:MagicalExoPlayer:X.X.X'
}
```


### Here we go for implementation

Add player view into your XML
```xml
<com.potyvideo.library.AndExoPlayerView
        android:id="@+id/andExoPlayerView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

Refrence to custom-view inside your activity or fragment (I use [butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/)), Or you can use **findViewById()**
```java
 @BindView(R.id.andExoPlayerView)
 AndExoPlayerView andExoPlayerView;
```
Or
```java
 AndExoPlayerView andExoPlayerView = findViewById(R.id.andExoPlayerView);
```

## Implementation Example
```java
 andExoPlayerView.setSource("URL OR FILE ADDRESS");
```

## Custom Attributes
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `andexo_resize_mode` | Type Of Video Player Size, you can pass **Fill**,**Fit**,**Zoom** |
| `andexo_full_screen` | Show FullScreen Toggle Button, you can Pass **True**,**False** |
| `andexo_play_when_ready` | Player Start Playing On Stream Is Ready **True**,**False** |

| `andexo_show_controller` | Show Or Hide Player Controller **True**,**False** |
| `andexo_loop` | Play video with loop modes **Infinite**,**Finite** |


## XML With Custom Attrs.
```xml
<com.potyvideo.library.AndExoPlayerView
        android:id="@+id/andExoPlayerView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:andexo_aspect_ratio="aspect_16_9"
        app:andexo_full_screen="true"
        app:andexo_play_when_ready="true"
        app:andexo_show_controller="true"
        app:andexo_resize_mode="Fit" />
```


## TIP
* If you wan to support full screen, please add this config into your activity in manifest.xml
```xml
android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|smallestScreenSize|uiMode"
```

For example your activity with be something like this
```xml
<activity
      android:name=".MainActivity"
      android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|smallestScreenSize|uiMode">
      <intent-filter>
          <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

          <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
      </intent-filter>
</activity>
```


* If you want to pass custom headers over your stream url, you can just pass them as a hashmap like this:
```java
  HashMap<String , String> extraHeaders = new HashMap<>();
  extraHeaders.put("foo","bar");
  andExoPlayerView.setSource("STREAM_URL", extraHeaders);
```
